## 👋 Hey, I’m Sean

I lead and grow dev teams and still write code. Based in Cape Town.  
I care about how we build software, how teams grow, and how not to overcomplicate things.

### 💼 What I do

- People and Software Manager at [Flatrock Solutions](https://flatrocksolutions.com), working across fintech, retail, and AI tools
- Building real products, not slide decks
- Mentoring devs, running 1:1s, shaping team culture (without the fluffy HR nonsense)
- Keeping things shipping and sane
